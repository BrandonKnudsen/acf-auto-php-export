# Automatically Export Field Groups to PHP on Save/Update for Advanced Custom Fields 


### Description 

The purpose of this plugin is to avoid the tedious process of manually exporting ACF field groups to PHP.  Upon saving/updating a field group in the ACF editor view, a PHP export of the field will automatically be generated and saved to a directory. 
I started this project to make life easier for developers working on Tordpress projects using the Advanced Custom Fields Pro plugin.

## Installation 


### Requirements 

* Advanced Custom Fields 5 Pro plugin
